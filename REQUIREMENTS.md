### Coding Task: **User Profile Dashboard**
 
---
 
### **Task Description:**
 
#### **1. Project Setup**
- **Tools & Technologies**: 
  - Use Vite for project setup.
  - Use React with TypeScript.
  - Style the application using Tailwind CSS.
#### **2. Dashboard Layout**
- **Header**: 
  - Display a title ("User Profile Dashboard").
  - Include a navigation bar with two links: "Profile" and "Settings" (dummy links).
- **Sidebar**: 
  - Display a list of users fetched from a given API or static JSON file (you can provide a simple mock JSON file for this purpose).
  - On click, display the selected user's details in the main content area.
- **Main Content Area**:
  - **User Profile**:
    - Display the selected user's profile information (e.g., name, email, phone, address).
    - Allow the user to edit their details with form validation using TypeScript for ensuring correct types (e.g., email format validation).
  - **Recent Activities**:
    - Show a list of the user's recent activities (mock data is fine).
#### **3. Algorithmic Challenge**
- Implement a function that:
  - Takes the user's recent activities as input.
  - Processes the data to calculate the most frequent activity performed by the user.
  - Display this result on the profile page.
 
- **Bonus**: Implement the algorithm in a way that optimizes performance with a large dataset.
 
#### **4. Styling**
- Use Tailwind CSS to create a clean and responsive UI.
- Ensure that the UI components are well-structured, with a focus on code readability and reusability.
- Provide light and dark mode themes (bonus).
 
#### **5. Code Quality**
- Ensure TypeScript is used effectively for type safety and clarity.
- Follow best practices in React component design and state management.
- Write clean, well-documented, and maintainable code.
- Ensure the codebase is organized and modular.
